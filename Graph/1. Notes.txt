How to identify - Dijkstra Algorithm
=============================================
1. weights given for edges
2. find the shortest path from source and destinations
time complexity: O(ElogV)
time complexity: Bellman-Ford O(V*E)

Krushkals:
1. Sort Edge list in ascending order
2. Check if nodes are connected or not using Disjoint set
